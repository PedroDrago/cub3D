### Studies




### Camera Plane
The camera plane is a vector which should always be perpendicular on the direction vector. The camera plane represents the surface of the computer screen, while the direction vector is perpendicular on it and points inside the screen.

### Camera Direction


### Camera Position


### Camera Rotatio
To rotate the camera wee need to rotate the Direction Vector and the Plane Vector. To rotate a vector just multiply it with the Rotation Matrix:
```
[cos(a) -sin(1)]
[sin(a) cos(a)]
```

### Combination



### Ray Direction
